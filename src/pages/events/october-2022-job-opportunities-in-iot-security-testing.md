This session will include an introduction of EWA-Canada, and the available job opportunities in IoT security testing, hosted by Zachary Cheema, and Joe Daws (both MUN graduates!).

<br />

The session will conclude with a Q&A for questions related to the job opportunities, but also general job searching questions related to the security space.
