We're partnering with the MUN Minecraft Club for a 'Random Drops - Random Crafting' Event!

<br />

<span class="text-xl">**November 6th, 8 pm, on the [MUN MC Club Discord](https://discord.gg/SEj78GfZ?event=1037155598648741898)**</span>

<br />

Players can (preferably) compete in teams, or solo (if you don't have a team still show up to the event since random teams will be created), first to defeat the dragon wins!
