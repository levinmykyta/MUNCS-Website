The server has been setup to be 99.9% Counter Strike Source content free, only the base Gmod should be required to play.

<br />

Once you join the server it will download all the resources, but if you want to fetch them ahead of time, you can subscribe to https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=227861993.

<br />

The server address is: `gmod.muncompsci.ca`, and the password is `compsci`!

<br />

Function keys can be used in game for different means, such as F1 to view info, F2 to swap teams, and F3 to taunt, and so on.

<br />

Thanks to Mudkip for setting this all up!
