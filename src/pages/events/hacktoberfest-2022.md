More information regarding Hacktoberfest itself can be found [here](https://hacktoberfest.com/)

<br />

If the project you're contributing to is associated with us, we'll hook you up with a free sticker as well!

Once you've made your contribution, reach out to one of our executives, and we will make note of that contribution.

<br />

<br />

If you are:

- Struggling with ideas for contributions
- Having trouble putting your contribution together
- Fighting with git / GitHub trying to put your contribution up

Feel free to reach out in `#development` within our Discord, there is plenty of people available to help you out

<br />

If you have an idea for a project that isn't related to one of our existing ones, but would make sense to be associated with the society / live on our GitHub org., we're open for that as well!
