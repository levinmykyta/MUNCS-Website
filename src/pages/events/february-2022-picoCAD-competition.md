# picoCAD Competition

We're hosting a [picoCAD](https://johanpeitz.itch.io/picocad) competition, from February 19th to the 27th!

<br/>

There will be a selection of different themes being released throughout the next week or so, each one being slightly vague / left up to interpretation.

We will also be accepting general submissions during the event as well!

Near the end of the competition, voting will open up for the best of each theme, but also some extra categories as well!

<br/>

There are a selection of channels in our Discord server (prefixed with `#picocad-...`), to get help, and showcase your work!

## What is picoCAD?

picoCAD "is a program to build and texture lowpoly 3D models", which itself is written as a [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) program.

The program can be considered hard to master, but itself isn't very complicated; the entire manual for the program (available over on its itch.io page) is quite small, and produces wonderful gifs such as:
