# picoCAD Competition

We're hosting a [picoCAD](https://johanpeitz.itch.io/picocad) competition, from February 18th to the 27th!

<video autoplay muted controls src="https://www.cs.mun.ca/~csclub/assets/posters/2022/feb2022-picoCAD-competition/muncs-picoCAD-comp.mp4"></video>

picoCAD itself is _technically_ free, although it is encouraged during checkout to send a few $$$ to its creator.

<br/>

Anyone is welcome to contribute to the competition free of charge, we have yet to finalize how exactly submissions and judging will go, but keep an eye out on this page / our socials, and we'll be releasing those details later.

<br/>

We're planning to have some prizes for the winners, but that is also not finalized; if anyone has some ideas, drop them in the Discord!

<br/>

There will be a selection of different themes being released throughout the next week or so, each one being slightly vague / left up to interpretation.

We will also be accepting general submissions during the event as well!

Near the end of the competition, voting will open up for the best of each theme, but also some extra categories as well!

<br/>

There are a selection of channels in our Discord server (prefixed with `#picocad-...`), to get help, and showcase your work!

<br/>

## Said themes are:

Feb. 18th: **Color**

<br/>

> Our first theme is likely our most abstract, for good reason!; feel free to just make something simple.
>
> <br/>
>
> Even opening up picoCAD to make a pretty colored cube can be considered a valid submission for todays theme; or you can run with it and make a box of crayons, or a pretty rainbow.

> The floor is yours!

<br/>

Feb. 24th: **Computer, and Memorial University**

> We've been more silent than we planned, but we are _back_!
>
> Not with one theme, but _two_!
>
> Computer: a box with a screen!
>
> Memorial University: a building, logo, animal, etc.

<br/>

For general inspiration, [the #picocad hashtag on twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/picocad) is great!

## What is picoCAD?

picoCAD "is a program to build and texture lowpoly 3D models", which itself is written as a [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) program.

The program can be considered hard to master, but itself isn't very complicated; the entire manual for the program (available over on its itch.io page) is quite small, and produces wonderful gifs such as:
