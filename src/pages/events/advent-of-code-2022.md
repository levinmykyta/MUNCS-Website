Advent of Code is a daily programming challenge that runs from December 1st to 25th. Challenges increase in difficulty each day.

Any programming language can be used to solve any of the puzzles. Players are ranked on the speed at which they submit an answer to the days problem.

There is a global leaderboard and optional private leaderboards if you wish to compete against friends.

<br />

Check out `#â›„aoc-general` within our Discord server for more information, and a code for the MUNCSS private leaderboard!
