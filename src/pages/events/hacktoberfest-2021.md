# Hacktoberfest 2021

Contribute to open source projects during this month, and collect some free swag from Digital Ocean!

<br />

More information regarding Hacktoberfest itself can be found [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

<br />

If the project you're contributing to is associated with us, we'll hook you up with a free MUNCSS sticker as well!

<img class="w-1/2 mx-auto my-4" src="/assets/events/hacktoberfest-2021/muncs-glitchy-sticker.png" />

Once you've made your contribution, reach out to one of our executives, and we will make note of that contribution.

<br />

If you are:

- Struggling with ideas for contributions
- Having trouble putting your contribution together
- Fighting with git / GitHub trying to put your contribution up

Feel free to reach out in `#development` within our Discord, there is plenty of people available to help you out

<br />

If you have an idea for a project that isn't related to one of our existing ones, but would make sense to be associated with the society / live on our GitHub org., we're open for that as well!

<br />

Note that for picking up the sticker, we will be making them available to pickup at MUN; if you are not currently in the province we unfortunately cannot get the sticker to you.
