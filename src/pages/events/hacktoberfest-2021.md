## Workshop

**October 28th, from 5pm to 9pm**

**CS 1009 (Computing Services**

<br />

Stuck on Hacktoberfest contribution ideas?
Unsure of how exactly to contribute with regards to using GitHub and writing Python?

Come to this in person event, hangout with some folks, and learn the ropes of the GitHub workflow, some intermediate Python, and contributing to our open source projects!

We'll be showing how to contribute to our Discord bot Automata, and the workflow from idea, to plugin creation from scratch, and pull request to GitHub.

Already contributed? Come and pick up your sticker early!

<br />

Please fill out this RRSP / contact tracing form beforehand!

More information regarding Hacktoberfest itself can be found [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

<br />

If the project you're contributing to is associated with us, we'll hook you up with a free MUNCSS sticker as well!

<img class="w-1/2 mx-auto my-4" src="/assets/events/hacktoberfest-2021/muncs-glitchy-sticker.png" />

Once you've made your contribution, reach out to one of our executives, and we will make note of that contribution.

<br />

If you are:

- Struggling with ideas for contributions
- Having trouble putting your contribution together
- Fighting with git / GitHub trying to put your contribution up

Feel free to reach out in `#development` within our Discord, there is plenty of people available to help you out

<br />

If you have an idea for a project that isn't related to one of our existing ones, but would make sense to be associated with the society / live on our GitHub org., we're open for that as well!

<br />

Note that for picking up the sticker, we will be making them available to pickup at MUN; if you are not currently in the province we unfortunately cannot get the sticker to you.
