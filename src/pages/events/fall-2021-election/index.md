# Fall 2021 Election

Welcome to the Fall 2021 Election for the MUN Computer Science Society!

<br />

We're following a somewhat similar setup to our [previous election](https://muncomputersciencesociety.github.io/election-fall-2020/),
with keeping the majority of the interactions online for the sake of safety and convenience; especially for people who have still not arrived into Newfoundland yet.

- **September 27th**: Applications for candidacy close
- **September 30th**: Campaigning starts
- **October 5th**: Campaigning ends
