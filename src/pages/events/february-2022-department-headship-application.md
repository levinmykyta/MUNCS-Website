> - A one hour Webex meeting will occur at 1:00 pm on Wednesday, February 23, during which
>
> > - Sharene will give a short presentation (10-15 minutes), faculty and staff may ask questions (15 minutes), and students (grad and undergrad) may ask questions (15 minutes). Faculty, staff, and students are all invited and can be present throughout, until students ask questions, at which point faculty and staff will be asked to leave the meeting.
> >
> > - Individuals will have the opportunity to meet online with Sharene. Gail, Dean of Science Office, will provide information shortly on how to book times for these individual meetings.
> >
> > - E-mail feedback on Sharene's application will be solicited and compiled. Again, Gail will be in touch about that process as well.
